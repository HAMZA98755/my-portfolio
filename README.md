## Personal Portfolio Website

A modern and responsive personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey.  
The site includes sections such as **About Me**, **Projects**, and **Contact**, designed with clean UI and simple navigation.  
Developed using **React** and **Next js**, the project focuses on clarity, accessibility, and professional presentation.  

This portfolio serves as both a learning exercise and a practical platform to highlight my work in software development and web design.
